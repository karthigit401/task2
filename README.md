Task-02: Titanic Dataset – Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore relationships between variables and uncover patterns and trends that can provide insights into survival rates and passenger demographics.

📊 Objective
To clean and analyze the Titanic dataset and visualize key relationships such as survival by gender, class, age, and other features.

🔧 Steps Performed
Handled missing values (e.g., Age, Cabin)

Converted categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked) into numerical format

Created new features (e.g., FamilySize, Title)

Visualized data using:

Survival count by gender

Survival rate by passenger class

Age distribution of survivors and non-survivors

Correlation heatmap
